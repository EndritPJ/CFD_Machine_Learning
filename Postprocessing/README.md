# Misc files for post-processing data

vmtk_cfdpointcloud2vtu.py allows point clouds to be saved back onto meshes (better visualisation than point clouds).  

pview_sampling_planes.py scripts slice along centerlines to create an array of planes which can be visualised or saved out as .csv.  

vtk_distance.py is used to compare distances between 2 surfaces and outputs a contour map.
